        <!-- Ethical Issues Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Ethical Challenges of Technological Innovation</h2>
            <p>While these innovations are transforming industries, they bring new ethical challenges. Below are some of the most pressing issues and real-world examples of how companies and governments are addressing them:</p>

            <div class="ethical-issue">
                <h3>Privacy and Data Protection</h3>
                <p>As more data is collected, privacy becomes a growing concern. The <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> sets standards for how data is handled. Tech companies like Apple are also leading the way by integrating privacy-enhancing technologies into their products.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ethical-issue">
                <h3>AI and Algorithmic Bias</h3>
                <p>AI can unintentionally amplify existing biases in data. Companies like IBM and Google have taken steps to promote <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/" target="_blank">responsible AI practices</a>, ensuring algorithms are transparent and fair.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ethical-issue">
                <h3>Job Displacement</h3>
                <p>Automation risks displacing workers in many industries. Companies like Amazon have created upskilling programs, while governments, such as in the UK, have introduced the <a href="https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Apprenticeship Levy</a> to reskill workers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ethical-issue">
                <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
                <p>Not everyone has access to the latest technologies. Projects like <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/" target="_blank">Internet for All</a> aim to close the gap by providing affordable internet access to underserved communities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ethical-issue">
                <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                <p>The tech industry is a major contributor to electronic waste and energy consumption. Companies like Apple are adopting <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/" target="_blank">green initiatives</a> by using recycled materials and renewable energy sources.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ethical-issue">
                <h3>Cybersecurity and Digital Warfare</h3>
                <p>As cyber threats grow, so do the risks of digital warfare. Governments and companies like Microsoft are leading efforts to combat cybercrime with cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity solutions.
